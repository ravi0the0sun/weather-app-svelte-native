This project uses the svelte-native-template made by @halfnelson.

This is a weather app inspired by @3stbn, [weather-app-react-native](https://github.com/3stbn/weather-app-react-native). Using `svelte-native` framework. 

# Usage

You can git clone this repo and add `environment.ts` in the `./` and export API_KEY from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/), then run one of these commands

```bash
tns run android
# or
tns run ios
```

### DO NOT USE THIS FOR PRODUCTION AS SVELTE-NATIVE STILL HAS ITS OWN ISSUES :smile:
