This is a barebones svelte-native project template. It was created directly from a nativescript core project template. It provides an easy way to get started with a svelte native project.

# Usage

You can get started with this using `degit`:

```bash
npx degit halfnelson/svelte-native-template myapp
cd myapp
npm install
```

Your svelte-native app will be found in the `myapp` folder.

Once installed use the `tns preview`, `tns build` or `tns run` commands as for a normal NativeScript application.

Example: install & run application on your device:

```bash
tns run android
# or
tns run ios
```
